# Craft CLI

Command line interface for Craft CMS.

## Installation

If you are on Mac, you should install via [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/).

```
brew tap rsanchez/homebrew-craft-cli
brew install craft-cli
```

Otherwise, you should download the phar: https://github.com/rsanchez/craft-cli/releases/latest

```
php craft.phar <your:command>
```

See [Composer Installation](#composer-installation) for alternate ways to install.

## Usage

If you are using a multi-environment config, you must specify your environment either using the `--environment=` flag on your commands, or set the `CRAFT_ENVIRONMENT` env variable.

```
craft --environment="mysite.dev" show:config
```

```
CRAFT_ENVIRONMENT="mysite.dev" craft show:config
```

Craft CLI is [dotenv](https://github.com/vlucas/phpdotenv) aware, and will automagically load environment variables from a `.env` file in your project root (path can be customised via `.craft-cli.php`). You may set your Craft environment by setting a `CRAFT_ENVIRONMENT` variable in your `.env` file.

## Configuration

Craft CLI can be configured in two ways. You may use the `craft init` command to generate a `.craft-cli.php` file. Or, if you have installed Craft CLI via composer, you may add an `extra` object to your `composer.json` and a `craft-cli` object within the `extra` object:

```
{
    "extra": {
        "craft-cli": {
            "commandDirs": {
                "\\Your\\Namespace": "path/to/commands/"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Custom Commands

Craft CLI custom commands are [Symfony Console](http://symfony.com/doc/current/components/console/introduction.html) Command objects. You can add custom commands to your `.craft-cli.php` or `composer.json` config by adding a namespace and folder path to the `commandDirs` object.

You can generate a custom command file using the `craft generate:command` command.

## Troubleshooting

### Your command-line PHP cannot connect to MySQL

You can test this by running this at the command line (change the DB credentials to your actual credentials):

```
php -r "var_dump(@mysql_connect('hostname', 'username', 'password', 'database_name'));"
```

If this prints false, then you know that your CLI PHP is not configured to connect to your database. This is frequently caused by an incorrect default MySQL socket setting.

If you are running MAMP, for instance, and are using the stock Mac OS command-line PHP, you will not be able to connect out-of-the-box. You will need to edit your `/etc/php.ini` (or wherever your php.ini file is located) file and change the `mysql.default_socket` and/or the `mysqli.default_socket` to `/Applications/MAMP/tmp/mysql/mysql.sock`.

## Composer Installation

You can install globally:

```
composer global require craft-cli/cli
```

Make sure your global composer installation is added to your PATH in your `~/.bash_profile` (or `~/.profile` or `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`) so that you may run the binary from the command line:

```
export PATH=~/.composer/vendor/bin:$PATH
```

Or, you can install on a per project basis, rather than globally to your host system.

```
composer require craft-cli/cli
```

Then the command would be found in your `vendor/bin` folder, so you'd run this at your command line:

```
vendor/bin/craft <your:command>
```
